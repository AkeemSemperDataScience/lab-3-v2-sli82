<b>Note for #2:</b>
The description of float leaves a little ambiguity here. The intention is for that to mean that the function can accept "anything that is valid as a float", not only things that are already typed as a float. For example, 5 is an integer, and if we make code of n = 5, then the type of n will be "int". That value of 5 is also valid as a float, even though its type is currently int. My meaning was that this number should be accepted and work, because 5 is a valid value for a float to have - if someone told you that "this function accepts two floats and returns their product", I think the most reasonable interpretation would be what I did - if the argument is a valid float, use it, if it isn't, then that input is invalid.
